/*
 * Problem statement :
 *  
 * Producer-Consumer Problem: 
 * 
 * This is a classic problem that demonstrates the use of synchronization in Java. 
 * The goal is to have one or more producers adding elements to a shared buffer, while one or more consumers remove elements from the buffer. 
 * The challenge is to ensure that the producers do not overwrite elements that have not yet been consumed, 
 * and that the consumers do not attempt to remove elements that have not yet been produced.
